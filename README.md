# Total Steps — Support Site

Static support site for the Total Steps iOS app. Open `index.html` in any modern browser to view the English support content, including FAQ, troubleshooting steps, and privacy policy.

## GitHub Pages

The repository root is ready for GitHub Pages. Publish the `main` branch with the root folder selected and Pages will serve `index.html`. The `.nojekyll` file bypasses Jekyll processing so the static assets are served as-is.
